# Podcast_listening_time_prediction

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the popularity of podcasts using a regression model. By analyzing various podcast features (such as duration, episode count, genre, and more), we apply supervised machine learning techniques to forecast the average listening time per episode.

🧠 Key Features
End-to-end regression pipeline (EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation)

Feature engineering for categorical and text-based podcast attributes

Multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Model performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²

Visualizations of residuals and prediction accuracy

📈 Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Model selection was based on performance metrics and generalization to unseen data.
